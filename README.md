**Forgery Detection Platform**

---

**Overview:**

The Forgery Detection Platform is a comprehensive solution designed to detect and classify fraudulent content across both text and image modalities. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques in Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning (DL), the platform offers robust forgery detection capabilities, empowering users to identify and mitigate the risks associated with manipulated or falsified content.

**Key Features:**

1. **Multimodal Forgery Detection:** Utilizes CV, NLP, and DL techniques to analyze and classify both text and image content for signs of forgery or manipulation.

2. **Computer Vision (CV) Techniques:**
   - Implements pretrained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19) and Error Level Analysis (ELA) for image forgery detection.
   - Extracts high-level features and performs forensic analysis to identify irregularities indicative of image tampering.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Methods:**
   - Cleans and preprocesses textual data using tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming techniques.
   - Trains LSTM networks to learn patterns and linguistic cues associated with fraudulent text content.

4. **Deep Learning (DL) Capabilities:**
   - Integrates information from both text and image modalities for multimodal forgery detection.
   - Trains and fine-tunes deep learning models on large datasets to achieve enhanced accuracy and robustness.

5. **Interpretability and Visualization:**
   - Provides intuitive visualization tools, such as ELA-highlighted regions and classification outcomes, to aid in result interpretation.
   - Enhances transparency and usability by offering clear insights into forgery detection results.

6. **Scalability and Adaptability:**
   - Offers scalability and adaptability to handle diverse types of forgery across various domains and applications.
   - Suitable for applications ranging from social media content moderation to document authentication.
